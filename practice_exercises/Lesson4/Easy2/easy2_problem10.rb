What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby? 

- It allows us to add more complexity to our applications.
- Allows us to modularize our programs
- through inheritance and mixins, we are able to create complex behaviours between our classes. 
- it allows us to add a conceptual dessign to our applications again by stablishing inheritance and mixins relationships. 




Because there are so many benefits to using OOP we will just summarize some of the major ones:

    Creating objects allows programmers to think more abstractly about the code they are writing.
    Objects are represented by nouns so are easier to conceptualize.

    It allows us to only expose functionality to the parts of code that need it, meaning namespace issues are much harder to come across.

    It allows us to easily give functionality to different parts of an application without duplication.
    We can build applications faster as we can reuse pre-written code.
    
    As the software becomes more complex this complexity can be more easily managed.
